# Raspberry Pi 3 (model B) - Notes
## Available operating systems
I will only list those that I think are great. You can see the list of other operating systems in the [Raspberry Pi official website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) and in [this Raspberry Pi StackExchange question](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/534/definitive-list-of-operating-systems).

 * [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) - Flagship OS for Raspberry Pi and by far the most supported. Lite version fits in under 2GB and has no graphical interface.
 * [Nard SDK](http://www.arbetsmyra.dyndns.org/nard/)*** - Committed to stability, simplicity, long term maintainability and lightweight design. Loads in RAM at startup and can have its storage device removed after boot.
 * [Flint OS](https://flintos.io/)*** - Based on Chromium OS. Claims to be working on the ability to run Android apps.
 * [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/)*** - Very lightweight distro.
 * [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/download/)*** - Linux distribution for retro gaming.
 * [OSMC](https://osmc.tv/)*** - Beautiful media center.
 
*** did not test yet, but seems like a great option.

**TODO:** Size and features comparison table
